Overview:
  
The Human Detection Application is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI)program that combines real-time human detection capabilities with an interactive terminal that simulates code typing. It utilizes the YOLOv5 deep learning model for detecting human presence in video streams or images and provides a visually engaging terminal interface. Users can launch a camera feed, select video files, or choose images for analysis, all while observing a terminal that simulates the dynamic typing of code.

Key Features:

Real-Time Human Detection:
Utilizes the YOLOv5 model for efficient and accurate detection of human figures in video streams or images.
Supports various input sources, including the default webcam, Phone Camera, or video files selected by the user.
        
Real-Time Object Detection:
Utilizes the YOLOv5 model for efficient and accurate detection of human figures in video streams or images.
Supports various input sources, including the default webcam, Phone Camera, or video files selected by the user.

User-Friendly GUI:

Built with Tkinter, the application offers a straightforward interface for users to navigate and execute various functionalities.
Includes buttons for launching the camera, connecting to Phone Camera, selecting video files, and choosing images for human detection.
Displays the count of detected humans in real-time on the video feed or image.
        
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:
        Tkinter for GUI development
        OpenCV for image processing and video capture
        Pygame for sound playback
        PyTorch for loading the YOLOv5 model
